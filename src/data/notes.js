        body: "When I tell people what we are doing, they want to hear about the room where you produce. I tell them that there is a lot of paperwork. That they take your picture and look at your license. Then they walk you back to the room. You are handed a list of instructions and some stickers and a plastic cup. The cup has a forest-green lid. In the room is a VCR. I like to write down the names of the videos so I can share them with my wife and friends: Ass Angels #4, Original Black Queens of Porn (Afro-Centrix #113), and Chock Full of Asians. The latter features a woman with enlarged breasts so swollen they look luminous, like the sense apparatus of a recently discovered deep-sea fish."

        title: "The Wager",
        body: "Willy Fog hires Rigodon, a former circus performer, to replace the butler he dismissed the previous day and, unknowingly, hires Rigodon's friend, Tico, at the same time. Later, Fog tells his fellows at London's Reform Club that he has read an article which suggests one can travel around the world in eighty days. To prove to his skeptical colleagues that this is possible, he wagers half his £40,000 fortune that he can make the journey."

        title: "Bon Voyage",
        body: "As Fog, Rigodon and Tico begin their journey, Mr. Sullivan (one of the four who bet against Fog) hires a cunning master of disguise known as Transfer to sabotage the expedition. Meanwhile, Inspector Dix and Constable Bully of Scotland Yard discover that Fog matches the description of the suspect in a recent robbery at the Bank of England and are sent to trail him."

        title: "Phantom Blood",
        body: "Phantom Blood was written and drawn by Hirohiko Araki. Prior to working on the series, he created a manga that resembled the works of Hisashi Eguchi, an artist known for his art of female characters; Araki's editor, Ryōsuke Kabashima, angrily told Araki to never draw something as derivative again, which led him to take another direction with his art, and the creation of Phantom Blood.[28] Due to the popularity of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone at the time, Araki designed characters with muscular body types.[29] The character posing, which Araki considers is distinctive about his art, was influenced by a trip to Italy just before the serialization of Phantom Blood, where he went to the Galleria Borghese in Rome and saw Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture Apollo and Daphne. Seeing it in person from different angles had a large influence on him; he described it as overwhelmingly beautiful and intense, and unlike sculptures in Japanese museums and the figure posing of most manga artists."
